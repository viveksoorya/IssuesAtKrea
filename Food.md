# Issues
1. Nutrition: Is the food being served at Krea nutritious? If not, what is it lacking in? What are the means for resolution
2. Hygiene: There have been many instances of insects-in-food. While we all could use the protein, perhaps insects are not a desirable source. Surely, the vendors do not _want_ us to eat _insects_. Why, then, does our food have insects. Is it time to look at the kitchen? Are the 'annas' and 'akkas' that serve us food always wearing their hairnets and gloves. What are means of resolution of the issues of hygiene with regards to food?
3. Variety: There are people in the university for all corners of the country. Everyone comes with their own culturally infused set of sensibilities. Now, how do we accomodate for everyone's palate to a reasonbale extent, without having the living expenses shoot up? Any and all ideas are welcome.
4. Leftovers and waste: what happens to the leftovers? Is it recycled to produce energy or compost? What are things to be considered in our attempt to gain transparency into this issue?
5. Food sources: Is our food locally sourced and organically produced?
